# TQ-Challenge
This repo contains all the data necessary for the 2022 TQ Challenge. 

## Problem: 


Vlad works for a company that produces and maintains EV charging stations. His job is to check the stations from a specific area each day. He also uses an electric vehicle to do this, so he needs to charge it from time to time. Not all stations have the same specifications. Some of them provide a higher charging speed than others.
Each morning, he gets a list of stations that he needs to visit. The list contains the charging speed of each station, the position, and the distance from one station to another.
Using the list, you need to help Vlad to optimize his root in order to finish his job faster.

Given a list of stations with the distance between them and the time required to charge the battery(0-100%), you need to find the order in which the stations need to be visited and the percentage that you need to charge at each station that minimizes the total traveling time.

## Evaluation:

We will check the performance of your algorithm on the examples from the input file and also on the new test set.

The winner will be the one that will achieve the minimum total time for all the routes.

You can use the utils.py to pretest your approach.
